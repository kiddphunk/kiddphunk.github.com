		<font class="bodyfont">At the heart of the del.icio.us.discover visualizations is an individual user's graph, a representation of their link-space.<p> 
		The graphs in this set of experiments/visualizations are tag-agnostic; tags on any link are not taken into account, although one could
		easily imagine various ways to integrate tag pruning/filtering/matching to assist in searching, or setting the seed directions for an 'information stroll'.<p>

		One other obvious element at work is time. These are merely snapshots for a given time period (in this case,
		the beginning weeks of March, 2006) and one cannot step in the same collaborative link-space river twice (or even once, really).
<p>
Every hugely popular link started with one posting and a new link that has 1 person considering it important may have 1000 people within a week.
		Due to the nature of the link-space and the curves that fall out of it, the temporal aspect of these graphs is not of great concern,
		although there are many interesting predictive ideas to explore.

		<font class="bodyfont">The graph in Figure 02.02 is a representation of my (<tt>kiddphunk</tt>) del.icio.us link-space.<p>
		Each column of colored squares represents a different del.icio.us user. The 10 pixel x 10 pixel squares that form the body of the columns each represent a particular link
		from that user's link-space that had intersected my link-space. The leftmost column with the solid bar is a stack of my links, with the height of each square compressed down to 1 pixel to save space.
		<p>
		I can now sort by total number of links matched and graph in descending order. This creates a characteristic power-law distribution

		The internal algorithm works simply by looking at every link that the main user has book-marked, and
		hashing all of the users who have also book-marked this same link. However, more interesting than the
		degree of overlap between del.icio.us users' link-space is the degree of popularity for a given link,
		especially when considering the "sweet spots". The colors in this particular graph (02.02) plot links of a popularity number '<tt>P</tt>' (the number of other people linking to the same link) 
		using the following formula:
		<p><tt>
		common = grey = (P > 1000)<br>
		<font color="#0000ff">popular = blue = (20 < P <= 1000)<br></font>

		<p>
		The link squares are now colored to match popularity and within each column are further sorted with the most popular links at the top in grey, followed by a gradiented blue representing the "middle ground", 
		then the more random (less-popular) links at the bottom in orange and finally red.

	A simple weighting algorithm was utilized to 'bubble up' users who matched more of the less-popular links (those
	in red/orange). The first weighted sorting variant I utilized gave a score of <tt>1</tt> was given for grey links, <tt>2</tt> for blue, <tt>3</tt> for orange and <tt>4</tt> for red.
	The results of this sorting method is shown for user <tt>REAS</tt> in Figure 02.03 above. Another weighting method experimented with
	only assigned scores to links in the red/orange set. Additionally tweaking the thresholds for grey/orange/red in conjunction with
	various sorting methods gives finer grained control for different visualizations.
	<p>

	One optimization that I did not have time to implement were sorting modes 
	that found users with higher internal red/orange matching percentages by considering the total number of links in an individual's link-space.

		<font class="bodyfont">Figure 02.04 above shows four user graphs, all recognizably power law distributions.
		While at first this surprised me, after researching more about power laws and scale-free networks I find this
		now intuitively sound.<p>
<i>"What matters is this: Diversity plus freedom of choice creates inequality, and the greater the diversity, the more extreme the inequality... The very act of choosing, spread widely enough and freely enough, creates a power law distribution."		</i>
<p>
(Excerpt from <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html"><i>Power Laws, Weblogs, and Inequality</i></a>, <br>see also Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network"><i>Scale-free networks</i></a> for more background information on social networks and the power law distribution.)

		This is an important feature to note because it means that the top N user's intersections cover a much wider span of links (which may in turn
		imply a good future predictive capacity for that user, especially when coupled with an appropriate sorting algorithm) than the next N users.<p> 
		
		So a rather small sampling of users taken in the form of 
		monitoring their 'link stream' or as an on-demand summary could give a fairly decent sampling of interesting links based on past link history, assuming
		an adequate amount of information has been accumulated.

		In addition, while Figure 02.04 lacks a value for the red parameter in this particular rendering, a quick comparison of curves still affords a few general observations:
		<p>
		* <tt>quarket</tt> has the highest proportion of less-popular links (the orange) than <tt>REAS</tt>, who in turn has a higher orange proportion than <tt>kiddphunk</tt>.<p>
		* while <tt>quarket</tt> and <tt>REAS</tt> have roughly the same number of book-marks in their respective link-spaces and a very roughly similar amount of less-popular
		links, <tt>quarket</tt> overall has much less area under the curve, implying that many of the less-popular links were not shared with anyone else or are very widely distributed
		across a wider range of users.
