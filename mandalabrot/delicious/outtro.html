		Hopefully del.icio.us.discover has provided food-for-thought, and
		stirred up or augmented related ideas around utilizing each other
		as data filtering nodes in our own right.
		<p>
		Many sites of course already utilize <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering">collaborative filtering</a> for
		personalization/recommendations, but there are many other popular nodes where the application of these simple algorithms (or more
		complex collaborative filters would, I think, generate a very useful source of new, more precisely targeted suggestions.
		Here are just a few examples of other implementations:

		<b>del.icio.us</b><p>
         In addition to the suggestions already made, more temporal aspects of the collective book-marking can be exploited. That is, it would be nice
                to know what other people have book-marked the same links recently as I,
                as I add a new link, or even to make predictions as to what
                I might like to see next based on what I've recently added.<p>
         <a href="http://toptaggers.com">toptaggers</a> offers a 
                  <a href="http://toptaggers.com/?cmd=helpful_users">list of helpful del.icio.us users</a>, which ranks users
                  based on their book-marking links with meaningful tags (as evidenced by others subsequently doing the same). It also
                  offers a <a href='http://toptaggers.com/?cmd=expert_suggestions&user=kiddphunk&tag=architecture'>mechanism for suggesting users</a> that, for
                  a given user and tag, have the highest overlap. This is a great mechanism for finding the popular links and sources for new links,
                  although it is tag-based and scores heavily on popularity.

		<font class="bodyfont"><b>flickr</b><p>
		Using essentially the same algorithm, one could find interesting
		photographer/photostreams or suggested photos. Every photo you add to your 
		favorites is essentially the same as marking a del.icio.us book-mark. By
		considering the popularity of the photos that are in one's collection (or
		even the popularity of other photographer/photostreams in your network) the suggestion
		engine would work in the same manner.

	<td height="246" width="404" colspan="1" valign="top">
		<font class="bodyfont"><b>blogger, technorati</b><p>
Similarly, by considering one's blog to be a repository for 'favorite links' akin
		  to a del.icio.us user's link-space, one could easily discover other blogs and bloggers that are on a similar wavelength.
		  Again, by considering the popularity of the links that are shared, one can avoid just
		  finding popular blogs and turn up ones that are relevant.<p>
		  One could then imagine a simpler, yet more useful feature, where only the last 
		  N-days worth of links that you have blogged are considered, so suggestions
		  are more aligned with your current subjects of interest. 
		  <p>
		  Regardless of the
		  
		 complexity of the algorithms used to do the matching, the key issue is to begin
		 to have the recommendations.

		As nodes grow and become mature, the data that is collected as a function of the node's operation and user connections is usually extremely rich
		and deserves to be better utilized. "Social" bookmarking sites are hardly social in the conventional sense of the term, they are more
		often "collective" or "public" bookmarking sites; the challenge is to add more of the social aspects to them, for example by
		exploiting the power-law shape of the user-link spaces to make predictive suggestions.
		<p>
		I look forward to greater interaction between us all.
