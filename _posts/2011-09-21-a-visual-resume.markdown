Every few years I will pull up my previous resume and perform the typical update with my latest jobs, skills, etc. I have always maintained a one-page resume; as new skills are acquired and pockets of specializations form and disperse, I take it as an information design challenge to concisely depict what exactly it is that I do.

Since around 2004 or so I have maintained two resumes: 


* a [traditional black/white (2009)](http://beatspixelscodelife.com/resume/ian_timourian_resume_0109.pdf) (admittedly *laboriously* designed)

* a [visual timeline (2009)](http://beatspixelscodelife.com/resume/ian_timourian_visual_resume_0109.jpg), depicting programming languages, location, work, etc.


While the former was what I sent around when needed, it is the latter format that I always thought had the potential for far more stories to tell. 

For example, I love to look at how my programming languages and toolkits of choice have evolved and proceeded over the years; most people would find it impossible to build up a mental map of that information just by looking at a traditional format.

So this year I hit a brick wall when I dusted off the Photoshop file &mdash; my old format could no longer transmit how I wanted to be perceived and I finally decided to recast my resume with more data visualization&mdash;I am, after all, an Information Visualist.

To keep the task manageable, I limited myself to the challenge of combining my previous two expressions of curriculum vitae, rather than opt for a complete redesign.
