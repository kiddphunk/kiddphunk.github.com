Although I spend most of my computer time programming, a Photoshop creation will escape the labs on occasion. I started on this piece one evening last June and then put it away until last week when I got the urge to complete my vision.

This robot has self-assembled completely out of musical instruments (except for the fan mohawk and rocket parts) and she is currently dropping some serious sonic science.

(So yes, hardcore computer geeks can have Photoshop-fu too! :)
