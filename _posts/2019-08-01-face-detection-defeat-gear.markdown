I was inspired by the work of [Adam Harvey](http://twitter.com/adamhrv) (at [ahprojects.com](ahprojects.com)) who has investigated various mechanisms for
<i>"how fashion can be used as camouflage from face-detection technology,
the first step in automated face recognition."</i>

In particular I was fascinated by the
["false-face computer vision camouflage patterns"](https://ahprojects.com/hyperface/) which I found beautiful - regardless of how/if the reverse training tech worked. (The [CVdazzle](http://cvdazzle.com) project is interesting as well.)

I then recreated similar randomly-generated fractally-scaled facial patterns using one of my go-to  creativity tools [contextfree](http://contextfreeart.org).

Finally I used the online custom fabric-printing / clothing-design service [Contrado.com](https://contrado.com) to create a slick hoodie with my personalized urban camo pattern.
