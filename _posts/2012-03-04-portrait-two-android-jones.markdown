Sifting sensual shapes of light and pattern.
A tribute to the artwork of Andrew Jones, this is a mosaic comprised of a historical merging of his digital art.
Thank you for all of the magic, Andrew!

This gentleman has blessed the world (and countless computers) with [Electric Sheep](http://electricsheep.org) and the algorithms behind the imagery.


I have been running his screensavers in one form or another for over 15 years. Crazy... and it just keeps getting better! Thank you for all of your hard work and vision over the years.


The mosaic was generated from a selection of over 10,000 seed images; the sheep here are from Generation 243 and the poster is approximately 1 Gigapixel in size. 


I used a Perl script to (respectfully) scrape the sheep images, the somewhat-buggy-yet-free [MacOSaiX](http://web.me.com/knarf/MacOSaiX/Download.html) to generate the image and post-processed / composed the poster in Photoshop.
