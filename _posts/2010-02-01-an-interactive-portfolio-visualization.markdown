[Launch portfolio](/portfolio/2009/)


I finally decided to create an interactive portfolio visualization that would satisfy my **own** curiosity as to the overall landscape of projects I have worked on over the years.

As I am constantly expanding my skills, I reached a point where I no longer truly discern discreet boundaries between my various interests: Information Visualization, Application / Interface Design + Coding, Graphic Design, Interaction Design, Information Architecture, Music, Art, etc.


The portfolio aimed to be unique, showcasing my Javascript development skills alongside my design ability, and consists of four main sections:

<img class="spanimage" src="/images/projects/portfolio/legend.jpg">

* **Navigation** provides pre-selected views of the portfolio (e.g. 'Developer', 'Education').

* **Dropdown** menu of metadata tags allows selection from all project metadata (e.g. 'Languages', 'Role').

* **Metadata** allows for a dynamic visualization of the interconnected nature of my various projects and interests.

* **Details** are provided for each project as well as a gallery that provides related images.
