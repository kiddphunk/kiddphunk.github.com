Dear Moleskine,

I am a huge fan of your notebooks &ndash; a quad rule notebook or two have been a constant companion for many years, collecting countless ideas and sketches along the way.

I have *one* suggestion: 

Please provide a notebook for those of us with fairly balanced right and left hemispheres &mdash; 
that is, I desire a Moleskine notebook that is a combination of your *[Plain](http://www.moleskine.com/catalogue/classic/hard_black_cover/plain_notebook__large.php)* and *[Squared](http://www.moleskine.com/catalogue/classic/hard_black_cover/squared_notebook__large.php)* styles. 

Here &mdash; I have taken the liberty of mocking one up:

![moleskine - kiddphunk corpus callosum edition](/images/projects/moleskine/moleskine_mock_s.jpg "bpcl_img_moleskin")

While the binding complexity may increase a tad, I believe the end product is well worth it and I will order a baker's dozen the moment they are released.


Expectantly yours,

kiddphunk


PS - Personally, I'd name it the '[Corpus Callosum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum "bpcl_href_corpus") Edition'
