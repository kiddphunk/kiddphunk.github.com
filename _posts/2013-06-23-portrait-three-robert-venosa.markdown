<!--
The mosaic was generated from a selection of over 850 seed images &mdash; fragments of Andrew's digital dreams.
Sifting sensual shapes of light and pattern.
A tribute to the artwork of Andrew Jones, this is a mosaic comprised of a historical merging of his digital art.
Thank you for all of the magic, Andrew!
