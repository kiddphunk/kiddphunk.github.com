A friend recently suggested I create a portrait of Robert Venosa to celebrate the life and passing of this great visionary artist. So I humbly present portrait #3: a mosaic comprised of a historical merging of his visionary paintings. Thank you Robert for a truly beautiful and inspirational body of work!
