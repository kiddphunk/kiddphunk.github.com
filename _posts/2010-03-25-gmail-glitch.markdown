A neat glitch just appeared in my Gmail Inbox: one email's previewed contents was incorrect,
*replacing a name with a different name from a previous email.*

<img src="/images/projects/gmail/i1.jpg" />
<p></p>
The preview above right mistakingly reads

``Hi Ian, Cliff Anderson added you as a friend on Facebook.``

and yet clicking through to the email reveals the correct

<img src="/images/projects/gmail/i2.jpg" />
<p></p>
The name that is incorrect was pulled from the *subject* of the last email 
(from the same email address); the *body* of that same previous email is

<img src="/images/projects/gmail/i3.jpg" />
<p></p>
This is an interesting bug because it provides an (accidental) glimpse into the 
advanced behind-the-scenes sentence parsing, structure analysis and (re)construction power 
just lurking under the surface here.
