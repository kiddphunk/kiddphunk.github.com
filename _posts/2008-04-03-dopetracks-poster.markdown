I was commissioned to brainstorm and develop an image for the [DopeTracks.com](http://dopetracks.com) one-year anniversary commemorative poster that incorporated the names of all of their active users. 

While primarily designed as a means of displaying the names of all of the active users, I quickly realized it could be treated as a simple data visualization as well:

* 5,485 unique users, each with a ranking and a date they joined the site.

* Size indicates relative popularity on the website (lower on the poster signifies higher rankings).

* Color maps to the date of the year (newer users are brighter).


I also assisted on an [interactive Flash version](http://blog.dopetracks.com/2008/04/04/omg-dopetracks-is-1-year-old) that allows a user to submit their name to magnify/find their location on the poster.
