As a result of my more active Bay Area clubbing days, I had cultivated a collection of flyers for countless parties and festivals from about 2004-2016. 
<p></p>
So I decided to go through and clean out the collection - preserving the more interesting, beautiful and meaningful - as some of these events were life-changing for me, and many of flyers feature amazing artwork from friends and the 'psychedelic art' community and deserve to be displayed.
<p></p>
I ended up making two 4'x4' collages comprised of myriad flyers mounted on clear acrylic and the pair serve as a time-capsule of over a decade of West Coast underground dance music culture.
