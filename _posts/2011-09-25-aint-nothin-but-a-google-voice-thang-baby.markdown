I love Google Voice. Admittedly, I primarily use it (and GrandCentral before that) as a modern-day door opener.
[(More on that below.)](#footnote)


Around Christmas 2009 I got the urge to call up my Google Voice number and leave a message to see how it would translate the 'a cappella' version of [*Nothin' but a 'G'Thang*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuthin'_but_a_'G'_Thang). 

**The way I see it, there must come a time when not only will this be nearly translatable, but I will receive voice-analysis meta-data along with the transcription that will indicate that indeed, Snoop and Dr. Dre just left a message for me. **

**I could then take the high-fidelity transcription and use it to generate a high-fidelity vocal rendering, using a pair of $.99-cent OS X voice-synthesis packs I purchased on iTunes that provide me with accurate vocal emulations of the two famous MCs.**

**Finally I would drop the generated vocals over the original instrumental track and compare to the original track from 1993. I propose this as a standard test for end-to-end speech recognition to &#10145; speech synthesis: <em>The 'G' Thang Benchmark.</em>**


Alas, the days of Snoop reading us our morning newsfeeds is far away; for the most part [the translation](/images/projects/gvthang/GV_translation_orig.rtf) is a far cry from [the original](/images/projects/gvthang/orig_words_raw.txt), although there are some funny interpretations:

	"And before me dig out a bitch / 
	I have ta' find a contraceptive"		

<center><h1>⇊</h1></center>

	"And before I get a chance. /
	I have to find the cats or step. If"

<p>&nbsp;</p>

	"And who gives a fuck about hoes / 
	So just chill 'til the next episode"

<center><h1>⇊</h1></center>


	"But anyway, I got off the flow /
	of just change but I think that's so"

<p>&nbsp;</p>

	????

<center><h1>⇊</h1></center>


	"That's hooked on that sucks blood /
	on the ball ball because of the brick at the house, /
	but it was destroyed it. /
	And they they call the phone. /
	Please put the sprint. So it looks like a home, /
	which is also just to look at it /
	would but I don't like that /
	that and it benefits like that. /
	Like cos i was like bath and stuff like that."

<a name='footnote' id='footnote'>Footnote:</a> You see, I still have an out-of-state cell-phone number &mdash; the same Massachusetts digits that birthed my first cell-phone experience on a Motorola StarTAC, somewhere around 1999.

My San Francisco loft has a front-door callbox that will ring the home phone to let visitors be buzzed in. However,
the callbox would only take local numbers and I haven't had a land-line in almost a decade! 

The solution presented itself once off the wait-list for GrandCentral: an hour of weeding-out Bay Area (415) numbers containing a 1 or 0, then cross-checking potential candidates with [PhoneSpell.org](http://phonespell.org), yielded a memorable phrase + local number.

Now when I am too lazy to take out my keys, I buzz myself in, involving an unfathomable chain of modern technologies and physical distances.
